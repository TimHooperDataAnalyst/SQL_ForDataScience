Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table;
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
   If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
   
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
   FROM table;

i. Business = id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id: 10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. User = id: 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posting more reviews correlate with more fans?
        
        Not always. 

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	      
        Posting more reviews does not always correlate with more fans. Sara is ranked number two with 1629 reviews but she only has
        50 fans.
        
        Gerald and Yuri are in the top 25 of highest number of fans. Gerald has 253 fans and Yuri has 76 fans. Amy, Mimi, and Harald
        are the top three for number of fans but have less reviews.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city or category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I analyzed four diferent donut shops... All had identical hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

SELECT DISTINCT b.id,
                b.name,
                b.review_count
FROM business b, hours h 
WHERE id ='260JIedrJp04Y5HBXsmAVg'

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

The location does not seem to have any particular effect on the analysis. Unless you were to conclude that of the the three locations,
Las Vegas NV was the only one that was in the 2-3 Star range. Maybe people there are grumpy about loosing at the casinos. =) You would
need data that covered more donut shops from each of the locations to really accurately analyze the topic.

SQL code used for analysis:

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:The busines that is closed is in AZ and the others are in OH and NV.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The business that is closed has way more reviews than the ones that are closed.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    I chose to analyze the number of stars a business has and whether the business is opened or closed in relation to the star rating. This allowed me to
    see if there was a correlation between the number of stars the business has and whether the business stays open or closes.
    
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
    I will need the business table, the id column, the star column, and the is_open column. This will give me the numbers that I need in order to count
    the number of bisness's that have a certain star rating and whether they are opened or closed. I seperated the queries into the following sections:
    1 - 1.9 stars, 2 - 2.9 stars, 3 - 3.9 stars, 4 - 4.9 stars, and 5 stars. I then calculated the percentage of closed business's and open business's 
    to the total number of business's for each section. 

iii. Output of your finished dataset and the SQL Code to create it:

     -This told me how many business's had less than 2 stars.

     WHERE stars < 2;
